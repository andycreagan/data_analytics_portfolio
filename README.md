# Andy Creagan Data Analytics Portfolio
## Introduction
Hello!

Thanks for visiting my portfolio. My name is Andy Creagan and I'm very excited to share my portfolio with you.

This portfolio contains projects I have completed by cleaning and transforming data using SQL and creating data visualizations. In upcoming sections of this README, I will share more information detailing my journey into a data analytics career and provide overviews of the projects that are contained here.

Thanks again for visiting my portfolio!
