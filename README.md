# Andy Creagan Data Analytics Portfolio
## Introduction
Hello!

Thanks for visiting my page. My name is Andy Creagan and I'm very excited to share my portfolio with you.

I am currently transitioning into a data analytics career after working as a project manager for over six years. My portfolio is very much a work in progress, as I am actively working on projects that will help me build the necessary skills required in a data analytics role. 

At this time, I have completed several projects that I am very excited to share with you. In these projects, I  cleaned, transformed, and analyzed data using SQL and created data visualizations in Tableau that communicate the insights uncovered throughout my analysis.

I plan on adding more projects to my portfolio, however in the meantime, I hope that you enjoy the projects that are listed below.
