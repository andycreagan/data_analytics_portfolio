# Andy Creagan Data Analytics Portfolio
## Introduction
Hello!

Thanks for visiting. My name is Andy Creagan and I'm very excited to share my portfolio with you.

I am currently transitioning into a data analytics career after working as a project manager for over six years. My portfolio is very much a work in progress, as I am actively working on projects that will reinforce my skills as a data analytics professional. 

At this time, I have one completed project that I am very excited to share with you. For this project, I analyzed a dataset containing information about passengers of the Titanic. While working with this data, I was interested to see what characteristics survivors had in common with one other. To see the insights that my analysis uncovered, click the link to the project at the bottom of this README.

I hope to add more projects to my portfolio soon, so I hope to see you again!
