# Titanic Survivor Analysis

## Summary
For this project, I analyzed a dataset containing information about passengers on the Titanic. My objective was to identify characteristics in the data that were shared by passengers who survived. 

To perform my analysis, I carried out the steps listed below.

### Step One: Acquiring the dataset
My analysis was based on the [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset) on Kaggle. I downloaded [Titanic-Dataset.csv] so that the data could be loaded into BigQuery.

### Step Two: Loading data into BigQuery
To explore the data using SQL, I created a dataset and table named titanic. I loaded the data contained in Titanic-Dataset.csv into the titanic table.

### Step Three: Data exploration
In order to identify areas where I could focus my analysis, I wrote several SQL queries that allowed me to better understand data quality, key columns in the dataset, and required data transformations. These queries as well as the queries used in the following steps are documented in [titanic_queries_with_comments.sql].

### Step Four: Data transformation


### Step Five: Creating data visualizations in Tableau
